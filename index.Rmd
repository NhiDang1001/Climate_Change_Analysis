#Introduction
- The data set provides details information and data on CO2 emission data around the globe.The data was collected by Our World in Data. The data is collected from multiple sources. CO2 emissions data is sourced from the Global Carbon Project, Greenhouse gas emissions data from the CAIT Climate Data Explorer, Energy from BP Statistical Review of World Energy and World Bank, other sources from United Nationas, Gapminder, Maddison Project Databases, etc. All data is generated by the following steps. First is standardizing names of countries and regions. Next is recalculating carbon emissions to CO2, then calculating per capita figures. All of the per capita figures are calculated from our metric Population, which is included in the complete dataset. These population figures are sourced from Gapminder and the UN World Population Prospects (UNWPP). The data is collected to update people on CO2 emissions (annual, per capita, cumulative and consumption-based), other greenhouse gases, energy mix, and other relevant metrics on an annual basis. Generally, it is an easy dataset to work with. But there are still a lot of null values. This means the comparison between these groups will be affected by the range and how many null values it has. A lot of information lead to a lot of potential analysis so it might be a challenge for me to fully understand, come up with specific columns to work with, and think of potential chart/ maps to work on. So first, I have to clean records where it is null for consistency. I need to pay extra attention when working with these  columns and always ignore NA values. 
### Summary Information

```{r summary info, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
source("my_server.R") 
```
- Which country has the highest cumulative oil CO2 within the last 50 years? `r high_county`
- Top 5 countries and its iso_code with lowest amount of co2 per capita:
- `r low_county[1]`
- `r low_county[2]`
- `r low_county[3]`
- `r low_county[4]`
- `r low_county[5]`
- Location (country and its iso_code) that is the lowest net exporter (lowest negative trade_co2_share): `r lowest_location`
- Location (country and its iso_code) that is the highest net importer (highest positive trade_co2_share): `r highest_location`

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
