# Climate Change Analysis

Climate change is a pressing issue around the globe that has differential impacts on individuals based on where they live and their financial status. 

For this analysis, I build an interactive Shiny application exploring CO2 emissions data compiled by Our World In Data.

## Data

Data: [GitHub repository](https://github.com/owid/co2-data/) (specifically the [owid-co2-data.csv](https://github.com/owid/co2-data/) file)

## Analysis structure

A multi-page interactive Shiny application that allows users to explore data about CO2 emissions, this includes:

- An introductory page (tab) that introduces the topic, describes the data, and provides some summary values from the dataset
- An interactive visualization page (tab) where users can control a visualization using Shiny widgets
- A page (tab) that briefly considers a Value Sensitive Design issue regarding my Shiny App

### Background
Hi! I'm Nhi Dang. I've grown a love for data analytics over the years. I took several data related coursework such as Data Science Statistics, Big Data Analytics, Probability & Discrete Mathematics at the University of Washington - Seattle, one of the top-ranked universities globally. I spend most of my freetime on learning Data Analytics and working on my own projects. The project I'm most proud of is the Seattle Pet Licensing. As a pet lover, I love working with Pet dataset. I've been working over and over again with this Seattle Pet Licensing Dataset, using MySQL, R (ggplot2), and Python(matplotlib). 

Now I focus on analysing whatever datasets come my way, automating my life wherer I can and conducting analysis on topics that interest me!
